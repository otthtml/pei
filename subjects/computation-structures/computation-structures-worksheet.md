## Basics of Information

1. You are given an unknown 3-bit binary number. You are then told that the binary representation contains exactly two 1’s. How much information have you been given?   
    - [ ] log<sub>2</sub>(8/3)  
    - [ ] 8  
    - [ ] log<sub>2</sub>3  
    - [ ] log<sub>2</sub>(2/8)  
    - [ ] log<sub>2</sub>(3/8)  

2. You are then given the additional information that the number is also odd. How much additional information have you been given? 
    - [ ] log<sub>2</sub>(3/2)  
    - [ ] 3
    - [ ] log<sub>2</sub>3  
    - [ ] log<sub>2</sub>(2/3)  
    - [ ] log<sub>2</sub>(3/8)  

3. A random variable X represents the outcome of flipping an unfair coin, where p(HEADS) = 0.6. Please give the value for the entropy H(X)
    - [ ] (3/5)*log<sub>2</sub>(5/3) + (2/5)*log<sub>2</sub>(5/2)  
    - [ ] (5/3)*log<sub>2</sub>(5/3) + (5/2)*log<sub>2</sub>(5/2)  
    - [ ] (3/5)*log<sub>2</sub>(2/5) + (2/5)*log<sub>2</sub>(3/5)  
    - [ ] (3/5)*log<sub>2</sub>(3/5) + (2/5)*log<sub>2</sub>(2/5)  
    - [ ] (5/3)*log<sub>2</sub>(3/5) + (5/2)*log<sub>2</sub>(2/5)
