## Basics of Information

1. You are given an unknown 3-bit binary number. You are then told that the binary representation contains exactly two 1â€™s. How much information have you been given?   
    - [ ] log<sub>2</sub>(8/3)  
    - [ ] 8  
    - [ ] log<sub>2</sub>3  
    - [ ] log<sub>2</sub>(2/8)  
    - [ ] log<sub>2</sub>(3/8)  

2. You are then given the additional information that the number is also odd. How much additional information have you been given? 
    - [ ] log<sub>2</sub>(3/2)  
    - [ ] 3
    - [ ] log<sub>2</sub>3  
    - [ ] log<sub>2</sub>(2/3)  
    - [ ] log<sub>2</sub>(3/8)  

3. A random variable X represents the outcome of flipping an unfair coin, where p(HEADS) = 0.6. Please give the value for the entropy H(X).
    - [ ] 0.97 bits
    - [ ] 0.96 bits  
    - [ ] 0.98 bits 
    - [ ] 0.99 bits  
    - [ ] 0.95 bits
