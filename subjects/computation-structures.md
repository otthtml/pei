## Basics of information

0. It's any data that manages to reduce uncertainty.
1. Different pieces of data reduce uncertainty by different amounts. More reduction equals more information conveyed.
2. In 1948, Claude Shannon tried to quantify information as I(x<sub>i</sub>) = log<sub>2</sub>(1/p<sub>i</sub>)

```math
\tag{1} I($x_i$) = $log_2$(1/$p_i$)
```
