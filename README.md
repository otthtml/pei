## Cool Markdown features to use

### Mermaid

```mermaid
  graph TD;
      A-->B;
      A-->C;
      B-->D;
      C-->D;
```

### Math equations (might only work on GitLab)

```math
\tag{1} a^2+b^2=c^2
```

$`H(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_{i} * log_{2}(1/p_{i})`$

**This one works in Github**
This sentence uses `$` delimiters to show math inline:  $\sqrt{3x-1}+(1+x)^2$
$$\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)$$


### Generic formatting

~I take that back~  
That is so funny! :joy:  
> this is a quote  

Here is a simple footnote[^1].  

[^1]: My reference.  

### Code

```python
def hello_python():
  print('heeey')
```
